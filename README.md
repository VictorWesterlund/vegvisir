# Pragma

Build websites the way you want. This framework is designed to interfere *as little as possible* with how you write your code and let you decide how your website should look, feel, and behave. This framework will take care of interactions, navigation, and asset imports; only.

## ðŸ¤· What's the point?

**TLDR;**

![meme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35688133/204326222-236a71be-5ea3-4653-8caa-6f6cfcd0d0d6.png)

Pragma is a foundation for a vanilla PHP website (with optional vanilla JS and CSS). It wont abstract away stuff like connecting to databases, sending emails, or call APIs.

## Example

No bells and whistles? Build static websites with only one page.

"/pages/{locale}/document.php" contains the following:
```php
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Will import and minify the CSS file at "/assets/css/pages/style.css" -->
  <style><?= Page::css("pages/style") ?></style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
  <!-- Pragma will expose your "/assets" folder as static content -->
  <img src="/assets/media/coolpic.webp" alt="A cool picture"/>
  <!-- Using data-trigger will call the method with data-action -->
  <button data-trigger="document" data-trigger="myCoolMethod">Click to say the magic word!</button>
  <!-- This will load in Pragma's interaction and navigation handlers -->
  <script><?= Page::init() ?></script>
  <!-- Will import and minify the JS file at "/assets/js/pages/script.js" -->
  <script><?= Page::js("pages/script") ?></script>
</body>
</html>
```

"/assets/js/pages/document.js" contains the following:
```js
// "document" makes this block listen for data-trigger="document" elements, it's basically which scope.
globalThis.pragma.Interaction("document", {
  // And "myCoolMethod" here was defined by data-action="myCoolMethod".
  myCoolMethod: (event) => {
    alert("Please!");
  }
});
```

### A simple website in Pragma

Let's say we want to build a simple two-page website. A langingpage and a contact page.

Pragma uses SPA-style loading to inject the contents of a page into a target element.

## A *sample* website in Pragma

[This is a sample website built with Pragma](#todo)

# ðŸ“¥ Installation

To install Pragma locally you need the following prerequisites
* A webserver (preferably NGINX 1.18+)
* PHP 8.1+ (preferably PHP-FPM)
* [The composer package manager](https://getcomposer.org/)

Assuming you have all that set up, here's how to get Pragma up and running on Debian-based systems:


1. **Clone the repo**
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/VictorWesterlund/pragma
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```sh
$ composer install --optimize-autoloader
```

3. **Point server root**
   
   > **Note** Pragma does not come with an executable to spin up a dev server. So these instructions will apply for both live and local environments
   
   Configure your webserver to route *all traffic* to your website to `{path-to-pragma-root}/public/index.php`. Pragma handles request routing automatically.
   
   <details>
   <summary>Example with NGINX</summary>
   
   * Point the root of a virtual host on your webserver to the `/public` folder in this repo.
      - This location should redirect all URIs to the `/public/index.php` file. This in turn
        will spin up the internal request router which will handle API calls and everything.
        
        ```nginx
        root /path/to/pragma/public;
        
        location ~ /* {
           try_files /index.php =503;
           
           # You need to comment-out the "try_files" line in fastcgi-php.conf as we define it here instead
           include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
           fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        } 
        ```
        
        
   * âš¡ (Optional) For better performance with NGINX: Add a location for your `/assets/*` folder in your webpage (not Pragma)
     - NGINX is really good at serving static content. Bypass the `fastcgi_proxy` by matching a
       location block for all requests to `/assets/*` with the following:
       
       ```nginx
       location ~ /assets/* {
           root /path/to/your/website/assets;
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
           # ... other stuff
       }
       ```
       
       This step is of course not required. Pragma will serve static assets automatically, but letting NGINX handle them directly is much faster.
   </details>
       
4. **Set site path**

   Copy the file `.env.example.ini` to `.env.ini` and update the `site_path` variable with the absolute location to your website contents.
   
   ```ini
   ; Example
   site_path="/path/to/your/website/"
   ```
   
Et voilÃ ! Navigate to the host you defined in your webserver config.
