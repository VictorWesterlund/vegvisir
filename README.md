<p align="center">Vegvisir offers a powerful solution for building high-performance, user-friendly websites with efficient navigation and a streamlined development process.</p>

----

Vegvisir is a powerful web framework written in PHP and JavaScript that simplifies the development of dynamic and responsive websites. This framework focuses on providing seamless navigation between pages using soft navigation techniques, while utilizing an efficient Multi-Page Application (MPA) file structure. Vegvisir also offers the capability to import and minify JavaScript and CSS assets specific to each page, optimizing performance and reducing loading times.

**Please note that Vegvisir does not come bundled with built-in database, mail, or other utilities. It focuses specifically on the navigation and interaction layer of your web application. You can easily integrate Vegvisir with your preferred database and mail libraries or services to handle these functionalities as per your project requirements.**

**Vegvisir is not this kind of framework.**

# Key Features

- **Soft navigation**: Vegvisir emphasizes soft navigation between pages, enabling smooth and seamless transitions for a more engaging user experience. This approach eliminates the need for full page reloads, resulting in faster navigation and reduced data consumption.
- **MPA File Structure**: The framework adopts a Multi-Page Application (MPA) file structure, organizing your website into separate pages. This structure enhances code organization and maintainability, allowing developers to work on individual pages without affecting the rest of the application.
- **Dynamic Asset Import**: Vegvisir simplifies the management of JavaScript and CSS assets by providing a mechanism to import and minify assets on a per-page basis. This ensures that only the necessary assets are loaded for each page, optimizing performance and reducing bandwidth usage.
- **Server-side and Client-side Rendering**: Vegvisir supports both server-side and client-side rendering, allowing developers to choose the rendering approach that best suits their project. Whether you prefer server-rendered pages for optimal performance or client-side rendering for interactivity, Vegvisir offers flexibility to meet your needs.
