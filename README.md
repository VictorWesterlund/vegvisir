***Pragma is not this***

---

This web framework is designed to provide a seamless user experience by allowing for fast and efficient navigation between different pages within a website. Using a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture, the framework enables smooth transitions between pages without having to reload the entire page.

Additionally, Pragma utilizes a Multi-Page Application (MPA) file structure, which provides a logical organization of website files and simplifies the development process. By breaking up the website into smaller, modular components, developers can more easily manage and maintain their codebase.

Furthermore, Pragma is built to support multithreaded navigation using Workers, which allows for faster page loading times and better overall performance.

Pragma is designed to be lightweight and efficient. Rather than including a broad range of tools and features, the framework is specifically tailored to handle website navigation and user interaction, allowing developers to build and customize their website as needed.

By only including the core functionality needed for navigation and interaction, Pragma offers a number of benefits over other, more complex web frameworks. For one, it is much simpler to use and understand, making it ideal for beginners and developers who don't need or want all the bells and whistles of a larger framework.
